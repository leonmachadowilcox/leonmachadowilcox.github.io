# Professional Self-Assessment

I began my computer science degree at SNHU in **[start term/year]** and will complete it upon finishing this course in **[graduation term/year]**. Before enrolling, I brought a decade of professional experience in Quality Assurance, but my exposure to software development was primarily from a testing perspective. Throughout this program, I expanded my technical expertise to include full-stack development, algorithms and data structures, database design, and secure coding practices—preparing me for an SDET-style role.

## Core Strengths Beyond the Artifacts

- **Collaborating in Agile environments:** practiced sprint planning, Git workflows (branching, PRs), and reviews without disrupting teammates.
- **Communicating with stakeholders:** tailored explanations for technical peers and non-technical audiences (from CS-250 SDLC).
- **Security awareness:** from CS-405 Secure Coding—defensive programming, common vulnerability identification, and remediation.

## Enhancement One — Software Design & Engineering

**Artifact:** Java Appointment/Contact/Task Manager • **Origin:** CS-320 Software Test Automation  
Refactored loosely connected classes into a more modular design, centralized validation, enforced ID immutability, and expanded unit tests. Result: clearer code, better maintainability, and stronger foundation for automation.

## Enhancement Two — Algorithms & Data Structures

**Artifact:** C++ Course Planner • **Origin:** CS-260 Data Structures & Algorithms  
Added guarded input in the menu loop, deterministic sort-before-print, and defensive CSV parsing. Reinforced understanding of complexity/memory and safe data handling.

## Enhancement Three — Databases

**Artifact:** Flask/Dash Animal Shelter Dashboard • **Origin:** CS-340 Client/Server Development  
Connected to a database for CRUD, introduced role-based access, separated concerns (blueprints + services), and improved UI/UX for deployment readiness.

## Professional Growth

I evolved from a QA-focused professional into a developer-tester hybrid. My QA background sharpened testing and debugging, while SNHU coursework equipped me to design, build, and optimize systems end-to-end. That blend positions me well for SDET roles bridging development and quality engineering.
